## 💡 Why Daily Live Calls Are Essential

### 1. **Reinforce Learning Through Repetition**
Research shows that spaced repetition dramatically improves retention. Daily live calls ensure you're constantly revisiting and applying course concepts, not just learning them once and forgetting.

### 2. **Bridge Theory to Practice**
Courses teach you what to do. Live calls show you how to do it. This bridge from theory to practice is where real skillsets are built.

### 3. **Stay Current with Market Context**
DeFi moves fast. Course material provides timeless principles, but live calls connect those principles to current market conditions, new protocols, and emerging opportunities.

### 4. **Get Immediate Answers**
When you're learning, questions arise. Instead of waiting or guessing, you can ask in live calls and get expert answers within 24 hours in the community forum.

### 5. **Build Confidence Through Practice**
Confidence comes from doing, not just knowing. Daily live calls give you regular practice applying course concepts, building your skillset incrementally.

### 6. **Learn from Real Examples**
Portfolio Clinics show real positions, real strategies, and real results. This is far more valuable than hypothetical examples in courses.
